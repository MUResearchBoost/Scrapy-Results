	Website: http://web.missouri.edu/~kattik/katti/katti","Our ongoing research activities involve the development of engineered nanoconstructs with capabilities for site specific targeting of receptor proteins over expressed in breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers. The overall goal has been to target tumor specific peptide functionalized gold nanoparticles on cancer cells/receptors and lesions to be able to detect breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers in early stages through sophisticated molecular imaging. The high Z value of gold is being capitalized for the X ray CT imaging of various tumors. The efficacy of our engineered gold nanoparticles toward endocytosis within cancer cells has allowed accurate detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers, via Photoacoustic techniques, with detection limits reaching 1-10 cancer cells. Radioactive gold nanoparticles (Au-198/199) are inherently therapeutic; through our comparative oncology efforts, we have succeeded in developing targeted therapeutic gold nanoparticles which have shown unprecedented therapeutic efficacy reaching &gt;85% in reduction of tumor volumes in both small animals and in dogs which mimic human tumors. We are also developing nanoparticles-based new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of age related macular degeneracy (AMD) and Pseudo Xanthoma Elasticum (PXE). Green nanotechnology is at the focal point of Katti's approach to pursuing research in nanotechnology as he strongly believes in total elimination of toxic chemicals either for the synthesis or as byproducts in the production of engineered nanoparticles. Toward this end, phytochemicals occluded within plants, herbs or from various sources from mother nature are being used in developing 100% green processes for the development of nano constructs for use in a plethora of medical, agricultural, hygienic and alternate energy (biofuels) applications.",http://bioengineering.missouri.edu/faculty/katti-k.php

His current research is focusing on: Multi-frequency impedance measurement for the rapid detection of JohneвЂ™s Disease JohneвЂ™s Disease is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in ruminants вЂ“ causing extensive losses to the US cattle industry (estimated to be ~ $ 1.5 Billion annually). Due to the slow-growing nature of the causative organism, Mycobacterium avium ssp paratuberculosis, it currently takes 10-45 days to detect the presence of the causative bacterium in test samples. Sengupta and William Fales, Ph.D., propose to develop a microfluidic platform and an electrical impedance based measurement technique to provide the same information in one-fourth the time (or even quicker). The technique relies on the effects of microfluidic geometry and the ability of individual live bacteria to store electric charge to pick up signatures of bacterial proliferation (or lack thereof) in liquid media. The microfluidic platform also potentially enables a large number of experiments in parallel in cheap disposable cassettes, thereby cutting diagnostic costs as well. Collaborator: William Fales, Ph.D., (Veterinary Pathobiology) Multi-frequency impedance measurement for the rapid detection of antibiotic susceptibility in clinical samples (e.g. blood cultures) Essentially, the same core technology used for the previous (JohneвЂ™s Disease) project, can, with modifications, be utilized to rapidly estimate the antibiotic susceptibility profile of various pathogens. Preliminary experiments indicate that they can establish the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of fast growing bacteria (such as E coli) in less than 7 hours (as opposed to 2-5 days using currently used technologies). Nano-particle aided separation and detection of pathogens ""Real world"" samples, whether clinical, food or environmental typically contain target pathogens at either concentrations too low to be detected, or mixed with many other species. Sengupta, Shubhra Gangopadhyay, Ph.D. and Luis Polo-Parada, Ph.D., are looking at how to use nano-particles (conjugated to antibodies) to enhance both the separability and the detectablity of target species/strains. At this point, they are looking to develop a generic platform that can, in the future, be tailored to specific applications in the enfironmental, food science, medical diagnostics, and bio-defense areas.

	Address: M210P, Radiology, One Hospital Drive","Thomen's research interests involve hyperpolarized gas MRI of lungs and novel MRI pulse sequences . An MRI typically uses a very large magnetic field to produce a very slight magnetization of atomic nuclei (hydrogen nuclei in particular) which can be detected by the scanner using rf pulses and magnetic field gradients. The fraction of nuclei in a sample which participate in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) phenomenon, and thus MRI, is called its polarization, and at field strengths used in conventional clinical MRI this fraction is on order of parts per million (ppm) - in other words only a few out of every million nuclei contribute to the detected signal of MRI. Hyperpolarization is a process whereby polarization is dramatically increased to a few percent (a 100,000x increase) using laser light rather than a strong magnet. This huge increase in signal is so high that a gas can be imaged in an MRI. Because hyperpolarized gases ( 3 He and 129 Xe) are noble gases, they are chemically inert and can be safely inhaled by a subject so the gas can be imaged as it fills the lungs. Subjects with healthy lungs show relatively homogeneous gas distribution whereas those with lung disease often show regions of defective ventilation. Thomen's studies investigate the nature of lung disease using these hyperpolarized gases and other MRI sequences which can quantify regional pulmonary structure and function.",http://bioengineering.missouri.edu/faculty/thomen-r.php

Soy protein is fast becoming a food protein of choice due to its abundant availability and health benefits. One promising and emerging technology for transforming soy proteins into palatable and consumer-acceptable products is high-moisture extrusion, which, unlike low-moisture extrusion, produces a meat analog more resembling muscle food. The objectives of this proposed research are: To develop a technique that can objectively measure the degree of fiber formation in extruded soy proteins. To determine factors affecting fiber formation. To understand protein-protein interactions and fiber formation mechanisms. To determine changes in nutrients and bioactive components following extrusion and conduct animal feeding trials for nutritional performance. Highly functional polyols for polyurethanes derived from vegetable oil. Polyurethanes (PU) are an important class of specialty polymers and have a wide array of commercial applications. All polyurethanes are based on the exothermic reaction of polyisocyanates with polyol molecules. The incorporation of triglyceride-derived polyols into polyurethanes is appealing because vegetable oils (triglycerides) from oilseeds and grains are renewable and because large polyol markets (total global use of polyols reached 4.5 million tons in 2000) could bring premium prices to these commodities. Current polyols produced in the industry using epoxidation/methoxylation of soybean oil as the feedstock contain a significant amount of inactive parts in the molecules. When these polyols are incorporated into the PU polymer structure, they would adversely impact the properties of PU foams. Several novel approaches including a combination of chemical and enzymatic methods are being explored to improve the functionality of polyols derived from vegetable oil in this project. The products will be interesterified with glycerin, diacid and other polyols to increase the crosslinking and functionality of the polyols. Based on the functionality and molecular weight of these new polyols, PU foams will be formulated and prepared and their properties characterized in the laboratory. Feedback from the laboratory and industry will be used to further improve the functionality and the polyols derived from the vegetable oil feedstock. Commercial technologies for highly functional of polyols derived from soybean oil. This project is a continuation of a two-year USB grant that evaluated novel enzymatic, biological, and chemical-enzymatic methods for producing polyols. In this continued effort, an emphasis will be placed on developing commercially competitive processes for producing polyols synthesized at the laboratory scale in the first two years. In addition, applications will be extended to include flexible, plastic and epoxy applications of the respective soy-based polyols and epoxies. A combination of chemical and enzymatic processing will be used to attain the desired polyol and epoxy properties.

His current research is focusing on: Glial cell function and neuron-glia interactions in central nervous system. In addition to neurons, other types of brain cells, generally called glia. Glial cell includes three subtypes: oligodendrocytes, microglia and astrocytes. Ding is interested in how astrocytes respond to pathological stimulations, specifically the alteration of Ca2+ signaling and its effect on neuronal function since Ca2+ elevation in astrocyte causes the release of neurotransmitters. He uses two-photon microscopy to imaging Ca2+ signaling in vivo and electrophysiology to record electric signal in our study. Stem cell differentiation and transplantation. The discovery of stem cells that can generate neuronal tissue has raised new possibilities for repairing the nervous system. The key to the success of neuron-replacement therapies is the integration of transplanted cells into the host nervous system. Ding's goal is to understand the mechanism of stem cell differentiation and study the function of stem cells after differentiation. He uses electrophysiology, fluorescent imaging and immunocytochemistry to achieve our goal. Ultimately, Ding will transplant stem cells into mouse brain to study the therapeutic effect of stem cell on neurodegenerative disease. Ion channel function and modulation. Ion channels are membrane proteins that can close and open in response to membrane potential change, ligand binding and mechanical force. The channels allow ions to flow down to electrochemical potential to produce electrical signal, activate signal transduction pathways, regulate cell volume, and mediate fluid and electrolyte transport. Ding is interested in studying the function and modulation of ion channel using electrophysiology and molecular biology.",http://bioengineering.missouri.edu/faculty/ding-s.php
